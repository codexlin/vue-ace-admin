## ‚ö° Introduction

> Ace (no need to say more-.-) aims to build a free and open-source mid-small size backend management system, based on the latest Vue3.4 ecosystem and other mainstream technologies.(: Ready to use out of the box, no complex packaging, supports secondary development. (Currently writing Java backend, other language versions may be written later.)

Ace Admin is a free and open-source backend management system solution built using cutting-edge technology stacks like Vue3.4, TypeScript5.x, Antd-Vue4.x, Pinia2.x, and Vite5.x. The project data is implemented via ApiFox simulation. Based on the exquisite theme of Antd4, I have constructed a clear and efficient project logic structure, integrating the latest technology frameworks. Welcome to use!
